BillShare is my first personal rails app! It was designed to replace using a
spreadsheet to split up my phone bill.

In essence it is a CRM. After signing up you can create bills and charges, track 
balances, mark charges as paid, and email your plan members so they know what to 
pay. Reviewing past bills is easy with individualized graphs on the member pages 
and the homepage.
