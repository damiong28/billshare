BillShare is my first personal rails app! It was designed to replace using a
spreadsheet to split up my phone bill.

View it live on the web at necro-billshare.herokuapp.com. It may take a moment 
to load the first time but the wait is well worth it!

In essence, BillShare is a CRM. After signing up you can create bills and 
charges, track balances, mark charges as paid, and email your plan members so 
they know what to pay. Reviewing past bills is easy with individualized graphs 
on the member pages and the homepage.

* Ruby version: 2.3.0p0

* Rails version: 4.2.5 

* System dependencies: Bootstrap

* How to run the test suite: rspec

After you have the repository cloned, run "bundle install" to install the gemfile.

Then you can create and seed the database by running "rake db:create", 
  "rake db:migrate", "rake db:seed". This will create an account you can use to
  login right away and view the sample data. Fire up your local server and login!
  
  The login is "user@example.com" and the password is "password".

Thanks for stopping by!
